1. What is the “anonymous turtle”?

A Turtle that python initializes automatically when no turtle object is created but turtle methods are being used. Used mostly when only one turtle is required for a program.

2. In the code below, what is the difference between turtle and Turtle()?

myTurtle = turtle.Turtle()

drawPicture(myTurtle)   

turtle is the library being called while Turtle() is the method that is initializing the turtle object.

Imagine that I have a turtle in a variable named myTurtle. What line of code will change that turtle’s y-position to 100?
